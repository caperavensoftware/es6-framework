create a todo list application that must be able to do the following:
1. Have a memory store where you can
1.1 Add new todo items
1.2 Remove todo items
1.3 Fetch a filtered todo items list based on a search string
2. Dom update
2.1 Add a item to the dom when you add a new todo item
2.2 Delete dom item when you delete selected todo item
3. Multi selection on dom for deletion
4. Complete a list item to remove it from the dom but not the store.
4.1 Allow users to view completed items instead of todo items and when it was completed
Don't waist time on nice visuals or layout, this is a javascript excersize. Make the right choices however on what dom elements you use for layout. example, use a button element for the buttons, not a image or div.
